# Slot Machine Simulation

This repository contains a simple slot machine simulation written in Go. The program simulates a spin on a slot machine with three reels, randomly selecting symbols for each reel. If all three symbols match, the spin is a winning combination.

This simulation does not currently include a Return to Player (RTP) feature. The results are purely random, without any balancing mechanism or theoretical payout rate. An RTP feature may be added in future updates to simulate more realistic slot machine behavior.

## Note

This project was created purely for educational purposes to understand how slot machines work.
It is intended solely for learning and experimentation, with no connection to or intention for gambling.
